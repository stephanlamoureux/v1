# #VetsWhoCode Capstone

This is my capstone project for the #VetsWhoCode March 2021 cohort.

I did my best to make it consistent across all browsers, while also being responsive for most devices.

It uses basic HTML/CSS with a sprinkle of JavaScript for the hamburger menu.

You can find a live version of it [Here.](https://slamoureux.github.io/vwc-capstone/)
