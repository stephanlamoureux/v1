			<p class="about-p">Hey! I'm Steve, a former grunt and a lifetime computer nerd. Here is a quick rundown
				on who I am and why I'm here.
			</p>

			<p class="about-p">Ever since I was about eight years old, I was obsessed with computers. That's when my dad
				came home with our first PC -- sporting a 28.8k modem, a 2GB hard drive, and running good ol' Windows 95. I
				would
				get yelled at all the time because I would constantly break things on it trying to learn how to "hack". As I
				got into my early teens, I taught myself basic web development using HTML/CSS, PHP, and MySQL. Flash and
				Dreamweaver were also pretty popular then, so I added them into the mix along with Photoshop. I tried to
				tackle the C programming language around this time as well, but resources were slim back then, and the only
				thing I had to learn from was the <a
					href="https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-2nd-Brian-Kernighan/dp/0131103628/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=c+programming+language&qid=1616889793&sr=8-3"
					target="new">Brian Kernighan book</a>. That was more than I could handle, so I continued to make websites
				and custom <a href="https://www.phpbb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">phpBB</a> themes. I then
				took an intro to C++ course
				when
				I was in the ninth grade, but I knew most of the things that we covered
				in class from trying to learn C. My school didn't offer any other computer science classes, and I also started
				to drift away from coding
				because it wasn't the <em>cool thing to do</em>. After I graduated
				high school, I enlisted in the Army, and I was out the door before my eighteenth birthday.
			</p>

			<p class="about-p">I started my military career by spending four years in the Army as an Airborne
				Infantryman. Following that, I transferred to a Mountain
				Infantry unit in the Connecticut National Guard, where I served for two more years. My body took
				quite a
				beating overseas, so I tried extending my military career by joining the Air National Guard. I
				enlisted as a Loadmaster on the C-130J aircraft, where I was able to work full-time for a little
				over four years. Sadly (for the most part), after a little over ten and a half years of service, I
				was
				medically discharged due to the prior injuries I obtained in combat.
			</p>

			<p class="about-p">After I was released, I spent the next few years going to college and working as many
				hours as possible. Shortly after obtaining my associate degree, I had a child, and my focus shifted
				away from education for the time being. I worked my way up the management ladder, and after a few
				years, I started to get back into tech. However, being a single parent, making the jump into tech
				wasn't such an easy option. I decided to go back to school to finish my bachelor's degree before I
				tried making such a drastic career change. I figured that with my years of management experience
				coupled with a bachelor's degree in management, I would have something to fall back on if things
				didn't work out.
				In the beginning, I would do some coding while I was enrolled, and I was able to finish the
				Responsive Web Design Certificate from <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" target="_blank"
					rel="noopener noreferrer">freeCodeCamp</a>.
				After that, the schoolwork started to pile up,
				and I couldn't multitask anymore. I stopped coding for about eight months until I finished my
				degree at the end of last December.
			</p>

			<p class="about-p">That brings us to the present. I created this project to enroll in the next cohort
				for the <a href="https://vetswhocode.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VetsWhoCode</a> boot camp
				beginning in March '21. This
				page will be constantly updated as I learn new things throughout the cohort to showcase my growth as a
				coder. I am finally in a place where I can focus all my extra energy on my craft and hope to obtain a
				lifelong dream of being a developer!
