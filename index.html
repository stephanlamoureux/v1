				<p class="about-p">Hey! I'm Steve, a former grunt and a lifetime computer nerd. Here is a quick rundown
					on who I am and why I'm here.</p>

				<p class="about-p">Ever since I was about eight years old, I was obsessed with computers. One of the
					first memories I have of coding was messing around with BASIC on Windows 95. A couple of years
					later, and I was trying to install Slackware Linux onto my old Thinkpad because I wanted to be like
					Zero Cool &#128526. That is the age where I also tried teaching myself the C
					programming
					language just by reading the Dennis Ritchie book. That was a little much for me at the time so I
					started building websites with Flash and
					Dreamweaver,
					and then moved onto PHP and MySQL. When I was in high school I took a C++ course, but after 10th
					grade,
					I stopped caring about computers and focused more on chasing girls. After I graduated
					high school, I enlisted in the Army, and I was out the door before my eighteenth birthday.</p>

				<p class="about-p">I started my military career by spending four years in the Army as an Airborne
					Infantryman. Following that, I transferred to a Mountain
					Infantry unit in the Connecticut National Guard, where I served for two more years. My body took
					quite a
					beating overseas, so I tried extending my military career by joining the Air National Guard. I
					enlisted as a Loadmaster on the C-130J aircraft, where I was able to work full-time for a little
					over four years. Sadly (for the most part), after a little over ten and a half years of service, I
					was
					medically discharged due to the prior injuries I obtained in combat.</p>

				<p class="about-p">After I was released, I spent the next few years going to college and working as many
					hours as possible. Shortly after obtaining my Associate Degree, I had a child, and my focus shifted
					away from education for the time being. I worked my way up the management ladder, and after a few
					years, I started to get back into tech. However, being a single parent, making the jump into tech
					wasn't such an easy option. I decided to go back to school to finish my Bachelor's Degree before I
					tried making such a drastic career change. I figured that with my years of management experience
					coupled with a Bachelor's degree in management, I would have something to fall back on if things
					didn't work out.
					In the beginning, I would do some coding while I was enrolled, and I was able to finish the
					Responsive Web Design Certificate from freeCodeCamp. After that, the school work started to pile up
					and I wasn't able to multi-task anymore. I stopped coding for about eight months until I finished my
					degree at the end of last December.</p>

				<p class="about-p">That brings us to the present. I created this project to enroll in the next cohort
					for the VetsWhoCode boot camp beginning in March. I am finally in a place where I can focus all of
					my extra energy on coding and hope to obtain a life long dream of being a developer.</p>
